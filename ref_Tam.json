+ name paper: Sketch  Recognition	Algorithmsfor Comparing	Complex	and	Unpredictable	Shapes
+ name app:  Mechanix ----> what's that? ---->  a computer-assisted tutoring system for engineering students. 
+ method:    ----> three categories: gesture recognition , vision-based recognition, and geometric recognition. For non-truss shapes like forces and supports, Mechanix uses a geometric approach very similar to LADDER
+ result:  comparison algorithm achieved a recall of 0.991 with a precision of 0.691

+ name paper: Deep Sketch Hashing: Fast Free-hand Sketch-Based Image Retrieval
+ name app: nope
+ method:    ----> In this paper, we speed up SBIR by introducing a novel binary coding method,named Deep Sketch Hashing(DSH)
+ result:   Our 128bit DSH leads to superior results with 0.138/0.142 and 0.210/0.105 improvements (MAP/precision@200) over the best-performing comparison methods on the two datasets, respectively.
